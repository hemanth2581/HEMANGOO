4. **Booking Creation**: Booking should be created successfully in local storage
5. **Navigation**: Should return to farmer dashboard after successful booking

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ Fixed missing super.onCreate() call in SelectSlotActivity
2. ✅ Fixed hardcoded slot data in layout - now dynamically generated
3. ✅ Fixed time slot format mismatch (single time vs time range)
4. ✅ Fixed slot loading and display logic
5. ✅ Fixed booking creation process
6. ✅ Added proper error handling and logging
7. ✅ Ensured sample data initialization

## Notes

- The app uses local storage, so no backend connection is required
- Sample data is automatically initialized when the app starts
- All time slots are generated for the next 7 days
- Each factory has 6 time slots per day (3 morning, 3 afternoon)
